/**
 * A transactional plug to manage internal state safely.
 *
 * CAF goal is to create and manage billions of long running, active, stateful
 * proxies, i.e., CAs, where "long running" means years. In order to tolerate
 *  -without human intervention- failures, upgrades, migration, or other errors,
 * the CA state has to be managed carefully.
 *
 * A complication is that CA state is not only application state, but state
 * associated with the plugins that the application uses.
 *
 * Also, CAF always ensures that CA state is consistent with
 * the externalized view of that state, i.e., CA actions that affect the
 * external world.
 *
 * For example, if a CA sends a message, and it keeps track of
 * sent messages in its internal state, even in the presence of failures
 * it should never forget that it sent that message.
 *
 * CAF approach assumes:
 *
 * 1. Operations that affect the external world are mediated by a
 *  plugin that makes them idempotent.
 *
 * 2. Plugins defer these operations until commit time, ensuring that, before
 *  execution, a persistent record of them has been checkpointed to an external
 *  service.
 *
 * 3. All plugins and application code coordinate using a two-phase commit
 * protocol, so that disaggregated state is managed consistently.
 *
 * 4. During recovery the last committed state is reloaded, and deferred
 * operations in the checkpoint are retried until they succeed.
 *
 * Methods `__ca_setLogActionsTarget__` and  `__ca_lazyApply__` defer methods.
 *
 * Methods `__ca_init__` and  `__ca_resume__` handle initialization and
 * recovery.
 *
 * Methods `__ca_begin__`,  `__ca_prepare__`, `__ca_commit__` and `__ca_abort__`
 * implement the two-phase commit protocol.
 *
 * Variable `that.state` is a JSON-serializable representation of this plugin
 * state. The contents of this variable are always checkpointed before
 * any state externalization, unless it is `null`.
